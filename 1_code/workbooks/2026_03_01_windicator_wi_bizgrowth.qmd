```{r config, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message= FALSE}


```


## Motivation

When analyzing the Business Formation Statistics (BFS) data in bfs_explore.html, we found that rural Wisconsin leads with respect to business applications between 2005 and 2024.


```{r lollipop_bfs, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message= FALSE}



```


This exact same pattern was found in the County Business Patterns (CBP) establishments data from 2010 to 2023, which provides more granular details on sector-wise establishment statistics (note to self: Was there a reason we didn't use the same time period, 2005-2024, as in BFS?)


```{r lollipop_cbp, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message= FALSE}



```



## To what degree does population play a role?

## Does the pattern hold using nonemployer statistics?
