# Clarifications

## 1) What time window do you want to validate first (e.g., 2024 only, or multiple
    years/quarters)

Answer: I don't want you to verify output per se - what I want you to do is verify the logic that was included in https://github.com/matthewjrogers/dform, which SHOULD be the same logic I outlined in ./agent-docs/agent_context/1_Project Overview.md ... But there's a chance I messed something up when I either 1) wrote the code from my understanding, or 2) tried using the original Github to write my own notes.

## 2) Do you want the plan to assume access to the mounted disk via input_root.txt, or should it also include a repo-local fallback path?

Answer: We'll figure out input_root.txt later. For now, assume all data can be found in ./0_inputs/. If there's something missing, tell me - but scope out data requirements in the execplan and verify it's all there before we execute the exec_plan.

## 3) What counts as “accurate” for you: matching CORI’s published aggregates, matching row counts between issuers/offerings, duplicate accession checks, or specific fields (e.g., totalamountsold increments)?

Answer: Ideally, I'd like to match CORI's aggregates. But if doing so would burn all of our tokens, let's instead attempt to match their logic precisely.

1) The CORI team uses the Form D data in this Github repository: https://github.com/ruralinnovation/formd-interactive-map. If it's possible for you to check our numbers against theirs and then improve our script, that would be great. 

2) If that's otherwise infeasible, let's just really make sure our logic is the same as what's in https://github.com/matthewjrogers/dform. 

Prior to execution, I'd like you to determine the feasibility of 1) vs. 2) above, and choose/delineate a path in the exec_plan based on feasibility. 

## 4) Should the plan include changes to 1_code/1_0_ingest/CORI_formd.R directly, or keep a separate validation script for comparison?

Answer: Let's plan to create an entirely new R script called CORI_formd_new.R. We can later compare and contrast the differences in output if helpful.
