# Agent clarifications: 

1) For figures 11, 12, and 18 - I want you to keep the grouping by the same original series but aggregate from the county level. You'll notice that the end of each county in the JSON file feature contains a state abbreviation - I recommend using that for the aggregation.
2) When I say "Acknowledge that these numbers might be off" - I want you to say that these numbers are pulled from the Form D interactive map, so might not be updated to reflect 2025 values.
3) Keep labor force from fips_participation.csv, but derive the numerator from the JSON.
4) Just say "since 2010" - Sorry, I never clarified that from my notes above.
5) Correct.
