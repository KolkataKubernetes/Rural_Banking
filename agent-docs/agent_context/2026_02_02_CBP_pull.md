# Census CBP Pull Requirements

./1_code/1_0_ingest/census_CBP.R Contains a function that pulls Data from the US Census County Business Patterns dataset, and includes a helper function that identifies available columns for a given year of the CBP. wi_2023 is an example of the output I want. Using the helper function to guide your efforts, I'd like for you to fill in the next section so that we obtain a single dataframe (wi_all) that contains the CBP data from 2010 to 2023. Let me know if you have any questions.
