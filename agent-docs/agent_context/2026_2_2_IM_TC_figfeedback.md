# Figure Feedback from impromptu meeting with Tessa Conroy 

We will edit use figures 1,2,8, and 9 to create a set of four new figures via a set of R Scripts. Name these scripts:

1) 1_2_1b_vc_dealcount_fig1.R (already started for your reference,)
2) 1_2_2b_vc_dealvol_fig2.R
3) 1_2_8c_increment_sold_percap_fig8b.R
4) 1_2_9b_deals_cum_fig9.R

Scripts should be stored in ./1_code/1_2_visualize.

For each of the scripts above, I want to copy what we've done for figures 1,2,8,9 - but instead of normalizing per million workforce, I'd like for us to instead have the denominator be business_app from BFS. Does that make sense?
